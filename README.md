# rsmpeg-vcpkg-demo 

This crate contains the demo code of [rsmpeg](https://github.com/larksuite/rsmpeg) and is configured to build ffmpeg with vcpkg, as an alternative to relying on system installations or manually built libraries.
A generic guide on how to use this build modality can be found in the original project's README.
